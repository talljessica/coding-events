# coding-events

The purpose of the coding events application is to provide events for users to find, save, and attend events
based on the users interests. Users should be able to sign up as a user, add events based off their
profile interests to their calendar to keep track of events. They also will be able to create events for
other users to find and save, a long with event tags for social media purposes.

The coding-events application currently allows users to create events, create tags, and search for events
either by listing all events that have been added, or by category (ie type) of event.

We still need to add user sign-up to the application. We intend on doing this by adding a Person class
that renders a form for a user to sign-up with their name, contact email, and a password. Then users
will need a profile where they can add interests in what type of events they would like to know about
and possibly attend. Lastly, each user will have a calendar they can add their events to in order to
track the events they are interested in.
